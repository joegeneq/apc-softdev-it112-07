**A. Tasks accomplished:** <br>
- Already talked with the client but with pending project approval. <br>
- Started looking for another project for backup in case the first client will not pursue with the project proposal.<br>

<b>B. Problems encountered:</b> <br>
- The client can't give final decisions about letting us do the project.<br>
- We don't have enough time to wait for their approval.<br>

<b>C. Possible solutions:</b> <br>
- Look for another project, ask for approval of the professor and talk with the client.<br>

<b>D. Next steps to accomplish:</b> <br>
- If the second project is approved by the professor, we must talk with the client right away for us to proceed with the project making.
