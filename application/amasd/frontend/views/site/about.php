	<h3> History </h3>

    <p>In 1954, the Assumption Sisters founded the Associate Missionaries of the Assumption (AMA) as a way of answering the many appeals of the world.</p>
	
	<p>Today, the work continues. While at their volunteer sites, AMA's find new insight into God's gifts through service to others. 
	It is through their service that they come to understand more fully the rule of life of The Religious of the Assumption: 
	"Love never remains idle: It makes us creative and impels us to heed all the appeals of the world and to find new ways of answering them."</p>
	
	<h3> Vision </h3>

    <p>“A multicultural Filipino society reclaiming its basic rights to peace and development in the spirit of faith, love and justice.”</p>

	intervention or in partnership with institutions and communities, as co-stewards of human and environmental resources. Our culturally-sensitive 
	services are rooted in faith, love and justice.” </p>
