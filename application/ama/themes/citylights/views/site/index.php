				In 1954, the Assumption Sisters founded the Associate Missionaries of the Assumption (AMA) as a way of answering the many appeals of the world. Young women and men committed themselves to work and live with Assumption communities in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, sharing their vision of the Christian transformation of society and working to make it happen. 
				<br><br>Today, the work continues. While at their volunteer sites, AMA's find new insight into God's gifts through service to others. It is through their service that they come to understand more fully the rule of life of The Religious of the Assumption: "Love never remains idle: it makes us creative and impels us to heed all the appeals of the world and to find new ways of answering them." 
				<br><br>The mission of AMA today, as it began over 50 years ago, remains the same and continues to enrich the lives of volunteers, religious, and those served.
