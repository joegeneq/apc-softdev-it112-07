**A. Tasks accomplished:** <br>
- Done with the Iteration 0 with Sir Joe Gene.<br>

<b>B. Problems encountered:</b> <br>
- He found out that only one of the members was doing the coding of the system.<br>
- He said that each member must do programming and not only one. All members of the group must program. <br>
- He told us that we must convert or have a version of the advanced yii for our project. <br>

<b>C. Possible solutions:</b> <br>
- We will work as a team and must divide the project on each member evenly.<br>
- Study how to use advanced yii and apply.<br>

<b>D. Next steps to accomplish:</b><br>
- Must do the parts assigned on each member of the group. <br>
- Present the version of our project using the advanced yii.<br>
- Commit it to the repository.
